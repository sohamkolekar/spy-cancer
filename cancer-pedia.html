            <p class="paragraph">
                The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) is a professional<br> "
                organization for chemical engineers.AIChE was established in 1908 to <br>
                distinguish chemical engineers as a profession independent of chemists<br>
                and mechanical engineers. Student chapters at various universities around<br>
                the world have also been established throughout its history. The student<br> 
                chapters tend to focus on providing networking opportunities in both<br>
                academia and in industry as well as increasing student involvement locally and nationally.<br>
                
                The institute opened membership in the Division to all, irrespective of<br> 
                membership in AIChE, and hundreds of scientists and engineers of all disciplines<br>
                took advantage of the opportunity
